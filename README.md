# AutoML

The AutoML project is designed to democratize the process of building, training, and deploying machine learning models, making advanced data science accessible to a broader audience. This project leverages the power of PyCaret, Streamlit, and pandas-profiling to create a seamless and interactive web application for automated machine learning.
